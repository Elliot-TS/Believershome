            <p>Mark and Tami were born and raised in the USA.  They are Christians, which means that they are followers of the Lord Jesus Christ.  They are associated with the <a href="christian-resources.php#who_are_the_brethren">the open brethren movement</a>, a group of local churches around the world that has no central organization.</p>
            <p>They both came to know the Lord Jesus when they were children, and they were both blessed to sit under the teaching of godly brethren who taught the Word of God.  Mark fellowshipped at <a href="http://www.centralbiblechapel.org/" target="_blank">Central Bible Chapel</a> in Palisades Park, NJ.  Tami fellowshiped at Bethany Gospel Chapel, in Worcester, MA.</p>
            <p>Tami received a BS degree in Biblical Studies and Elementary Education from <a href="http://www.emmaus.edu/" target="_blank">Emmaus Bibe College</a>.  Mark received a BA from the <a href="http://www.udel.edu/" target="_blank">University of Delaware</a> in Communications (Public Relations) and Foreign Language/Literature (Spanish) and an MA from <a href="http://www.rutgers.edu/" target="_blank">Rutgers University</a> in Education, teaching English as a second/foreign language.</p>

There, Mark taught English at <a href="http://www.wsb-nlu.edu.pl/" target="_blank">WSB-NLU</a> in <a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?formtype=search&countryid=192&addtohistory=&country=PL&city=Nowy+Sacz&submit=Get+Map" target="_blank">Nowy Sacz</a>.  He also taught the Word of God in a small church outside the city.</p>
            <p><strong>Today,</strong> Mark teaches the Word of God (in Poland, Portugal, and the USA), and Tami is often asked to teach at women's meetings.  They fellowship at <a href="http://www.montereychapel.org/" target="_blank">Monterey Bible Chapel</a>, in the Lancaster, PA area.

            <p>Mark and Tami have six children.</p>
